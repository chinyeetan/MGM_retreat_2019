### Introduction
- The search for commensal species in humans which promote health and abrogate disease has been a high-priority but onerous venture.
- Identification of a single taxon or small consortia of taxa that promote human health will spur development of probiotic drugs for a range of diseases.
- Host-microbe triangulation pioneered by Surana and Kasper (2017) identified a hitherto unknown taxon of bacteria strongly associated with a protective phenotype in mouse colitis; subsequent culture and characterization led to the discovery of a new species, designated _**Clostridium immunis**_.<br/>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.cap = "The first image of _C.immunis_ captured by Transmission Electron Microscopy. \\label{figurelabel}"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/CimmunisEM.jpg")
```

### Approach
- Immunomodulatory effects of _C.immunis_ were assessed using classical disease models with robust phenotypic readout.
- Finding out the 'where' and 'when' of _C.immunis_ colonization will educate the search for mechanistic clues.
- Genetic manipulation of _C.immunis_ is critical to identify genetically-encoded functions of its effects.

### Method
- Disease models of Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) colitis and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis (EAE) were performed as described in the literature.
- Gnotobiotic mice were orally gavaged with cultured _C.immunis_. Bacterial abundance in intestine and feces was assessed with qPCR. Intestinal immune cell profiling was done with FACS.
- Transformation of _C.immunis_ with ClosTron plasmids are performed by either conjugation or electrotransformation.
### Results
#### Oral gavage of _C. immunis_ into two distinct mouse models of inflammatory disease mitigates clinical severity

#### _C. immunis_ is localized to the cecum and proximal-middle colon

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.cap = "Intestinal segments and feces from gnotobiotic Swiss-Webster mice colonized with mouse microbiota (MMb) or human microbiota (HMb) were analyzed with qPCR using species-specific primers. \\label{figurelabel}"}

```

#### Colonization of the naive mouse gut by _C. immunis_ is short-lived 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.cap = "figure caption. \\label{figurelabel}"}

```
#### _C.immunis_ decreases the population of Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the intestine
### Ongoing work
#### Comparative Genomics and Genetic Manipulation
#### Detailed mechanistic studies: ILC3 knockout mouse
