### Introduction
- The modulation of our microbiome is an attractive method to promote health and abrogate disease [@RN2], but this has been an onerous venture given the staggering complexity in pinpointing consortia or individual species that **causally** impact host health from a laundry list of taxa merely **associated** with disease states [@RN4].
- Members of the host microbiota are known to regulate host immunity [@RN3], illuminating a potential entry point for microbiome therapy in autoimmune and inflammtory diseases.
- **A technique we use in the Surana lab**: "Host-microbe triangulation" [@RN1] had identified a hitherto unknown taxon of bacteria strongly associated with a protective phenotype in mouse colitis; subsequent characterization led to the discovery of a new species, designated _**Clostridium immunis**_.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.cap = "The first image of C. immunis captured by Transmission Electron Microscopy. \\label{figurelabel}"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/CimmunisEM.jpg")
```

### Approach
- Immunomodulatory effects of _C. immunis_ were assessed using classical disease models with robust phenotypic readout.
- Finding out the 'where' and 'when' of _C. immunis_ colonization will educate the search for mechanistic clues.
- Genetic manipulation of _C. immunis_ is critical to identify genetically-encoded functions of its effects.
<!---
### Method
- Disease models of Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) colitis and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis (EAE) were performed as described in the literature.
- Gnotobiotic mice were orally gavaged with cultured _C. immunis_. Bacterial abundance in intestine and feces was assessed with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Intestinal immune cell profiling was done with fluorescence activated cell sorting.

### Results
#### Single oral administration of _C. immunis_ mitigates clinical severity in two distinct mouse models of inflammatory disease
```{r fig.show = "hold", out.width = "43%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = " (Left) Oral gavage of C. immunis ameliorates lethality in DSS colitis and (Right) clinical severity in experimental autoimmune encephalitis. n=5 mice per group (DSS colitis); n=10 mice per group (EAE); Single dose of C. immunis preadministered before disease induction. *=p<0.05 \\label{figurelabel}"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/Survival-new.jpg", "~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/EAE-new.jpg"))
```
#### _C. immunis_ is localized to the cecum and proximal-middle colon; Presence of the _C.  immunis_ in the naïve mouse gut after a single oral gavage is short-lived 
```{r fig.show = "hold", out.width = "45%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = " (Left) C. immunis is mostly localized to the cecum and proximal-mid colon in colonized mice at steady-state, n=4 mice; (Right) C. immunis naïve C57BL/6 MMb do not retain C. immunis beyond 24hours after single oral gavage, n=9 mice; fecal pellets collected 12-hourly \\label{figurelabel}"}

```

How do i have auto figure captioning with in-line R script? If not can I just write code to generate figure with ggplot, export and reimport with include_graphics? Also wish to facet both localization and kinetics side-by side
Edit: Decided to import PRISM made files for now for simplicity. Older commits have the code for plotting localization from raw data

#### Oral administration of a _C. immunis_ enrichced culture decreases the abundance of colonic Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3)
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "45%", fig.cap = "Colonic type 3 innate lymphoid cells were decreased in mice gavaged with a culture enriched for C. immunis (HMb cx) compared to a culture low in C. immunis (MMb cx). **=p<0.005 \\label{figurelabel}"}

```
### Ongoing work
#### Bacterial end: Comparative genomics and genetic manipulation of _C. immunis_ to unveil bacterial products that induce protection
- I am performing whole genome comparisons between closely related strains and _C. immunis_ to identify candidate genes that confer protection.
- The lab is testing techniques to introduce exogenous genetic material into _C. immunis_, with the aim to performing CRISPR-mediated gene knockouts against candidate genes.

#### Host end: Unravelling changes to host immunological status mediated by _C. immunis_
- I am currently generating ILC3 knockout mice to confirm and study the mechanism of _C. immunis_ modulation of the host colonic ILC3 population.
