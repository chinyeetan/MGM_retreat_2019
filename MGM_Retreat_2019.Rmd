### Introduction
- Microbiome modulation is an attractive method to promote health and abrogate disease [@RN5]. Members of the host microbiota regulate host immunity [@RN3], illuminating an entry point for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
- Yet it is non-trivial to pinpoint species that **causally** impact host health from a laundry list of taxa **associated** with disease [@RN4].
- Mice stably colonized with human microbiota **(HMb)** are less susceptible to chemically induced colitis than those colonized with mouse microbiota **(MMb)**.
- A technique we use in the Surana lab: **Microbe-phenotype triangulation** [@RN1] identified a hitherto unknown <u>**taxon of bacteria abundant in HMb but absent in MMb**</u> that was associated with survival in colitis; subsequent characterization led to the discovery of a new species, _**Clostridium immunis**_.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.cap = "The first image of _C. immunis_ captured by Transmission Electron Microscopy. \\label{figurelabel}"}

```

### Approach
- Extending immunomodulatory potential of _C. immunis_ to other disease models.
- Elucidating the 'where' and 'when' of _C. immunis_ colonization to direct the search for mechanistic clues.
- Identifying changes in intestinal immune cell population induced by _C. immunis_.
- Genetic manipulation of _C. immunis_ to identify bacterial bioactive products which mediate immunomodulation.
<!---
### Method
- Disease models of Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) colitis and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis (EAE) were performed as described in the literature.
- Gnotobiotic mice were orally gavaged with cultured _C. immunis_. Bacterial abundance in intestine and feces was assessed with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Intestinal immune cell profiling was done with fluorescence activated cell sorting.

### Results
#### Oral administration of _C. immunis_ mitigates clinical severity in two distinct mouse models of inflammatory disease
```{r out.width = "95%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Oral gavage of _C. immunis_ ameliorates (A) lethality in DSS colitis, and (B) clinical severity in experimental autoimmune encephalitis. n=5 mice per group (DSS colitis); n=10 mice per group (EAE); *=p<0.05 \\label{figurelabel}"}

```
</br>

#### _C. immunis_ is localized to the cecum and proximal-middle colon;</br>Presence of _C.  immunis_ in the naïve mouse gut is short-lived 
```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "(A) _C. immunis_ is localized to the cecum and proximal-mid colon in colonized mice at steady-state (HMb); n=4 mice (B) _C. immunis_ naïve MMb mice do not retain _C. immunis_ beyond 24 hours after single oral gavage; n=9 mice\\label{figurelabel}"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/Fig2.jpg")
```

#### Oral administration of a _C. immunis_ enriched culture decreases the abundance of colonic Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3)
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "38%", fig.cap = "Colonic group 3 innate lymphoid cells were decreased in mice gavaged with a culture enriched for _C. immunis_ (HMb cx) compared to a culture without _C. immunis_ (MMb cx); n=6-7 mice per group. **=p<0.005 \\label{figurelabel}"}

```
### Ongoing work

#### Bacterial end: Comparative genomics and genetic manipulation of _C. immunis_ to identify bacterial products that modulate host immunity
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.cap = "Whole genome comparisons between _C. immunis_ and closely related species will identify candidate genes that confer protection. These genes will be targeted by CRISPR in genetically engineered _C. immunis_ \\label{figurelabel}"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/CG.jpg")
```

#### Host end: Unravelling changes to host immunological status mediated by _C. immunis_
- I am currently generating ILC3 knockout mice to confirm and study the mechanism of _C. immunis_ modulation of the host colonic ILC3 population.
