### Introduction
- The search for commensal species in humans which promote health and abrogate disease has been a high-priority but onerous venture.
- Identification of a single taxon or small consortia of taxa that promote human health will spur development of probiotic drugs for a range of diseases.
- Host-microbe triangulation pioneered by Surana and Kasper (2017) identified a hitherto unknown taxon of bacteria strongly associated with a protective phenotype in mouse colitis; subsequent culture and characterization led to the discovery of a new species, designated _**Clostridium immunis**_.<br/>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.cap = "The first image of _C.immunis_ captured by Transmission Electron Microscopy. \\label{figurelabel}"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/CimmunisEM.jpg")
```

### Approach
- Immunomodulatory effects of _C.immunis_ were assessed using classical disease models with robust phenotypic readout.
- Finding out the 'where' and 'when' of _C.immunis_ colonization will educate the search for mechanistic clues.
- Genetic manipulation of _C.immunis_ is critical to identify genetically-encoded functions of its effects.
<!---
### Method
- Disease models of Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) colitis and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis (EAE) were performed as described in the literature.
- Gnotobiotic mice were orally gavaged with cultured _C.immunis_. Bacterial abundance in intestine and feces was assessed with qPCR. Intestinal immune cell profiling was done with FACS.
- Transformation of _C.immunis_ with ClosTron plasmids are performed by either conjugation or electrotransformation.

### Results
#### Oral gavage of _C. immunis_ into two distinct mouse models of inflammatory disease mitigates clinical severity

```{r fig.show = "hold", out.width = "35%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "C. immunis gavage ameliorates lethality in DSS colitis (left) and clinical severity in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (right). \\label{figurelabel}"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/Survival.jpg", "~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/EAE.jpg"))
```
#### _C. immunis_ is localized to the cecum and proximal-middle colon

```{r}
loc=read.csv("~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/data/HMb_Rdata.csv", sep="," , header=TRUE)
loc$Region <- factor(loc$Region, levels=c("Duo", "Jej", "Ile", "Cec", "Prox Col", "Mid Col", "Dist Col", "Feces"))
library("ggplot2")
localization<-ggplot(data=loc, mapping = aes (x=Region, y=Percent)) + geom_boxplot(
  fill="white"
) +geom_dotplot(
    binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center",
    fill = "black"
    ) + labs(title="Clostridium immunis abundance along \nintestinal tract", x= "Intestinal Region",y = "% of all bacteria",
             caption = "Intestinal Segments and feces from gnotobiotic Swiss-Webster mice colonized with human microbiota were analyzed with C. immunis specific primers by qPCR") 
localization_theme <- theme(
  plot.title = element_text(family = "Helvetica", face = "bold", size = (20), hjust = 0.5),
  plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0),
  axis.title.x = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = (15), colour = "black", margin = margin(10,0,0,0)),
  axis.title.y = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = (15), colour = "black", margin = margin(0,10,0,0)),
                              axis.text.x = element_text(family= "Helvetica", size = (12), colour = "black"),
                              axis.text.y = element_text(family= "Helvetica", size = (12), colour = "black"))
print(localization + localization_theme)
```

How do i have auto figure captioning with in-line R script? If not can I just write code to generate figure with ggplot, export and reimport with include_graphics? Also wish to facet both localization and kinetics side-by side

#### Colonization of the naive mouse gut by _C. immunis_ is short-lived 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.cap = "figure caption. \\label{figurelabel}"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/CYposters/CYT_posterdown/images/Kinetics.jpg")
```
#### _C.immunis_ decreases the population of Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the intestine

#### Comparative Genomics and Genetic Manipulation
